This API provides an interface for calculating charges, queuing transactions and generating transaction files used to produce invoices.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- [Node.js v16.*](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL v12](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

First clone the repository and then drop into your new local repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-system.git && cd water-abstraction-system
```

Our preference is to run the database and API within Docker, so [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have it.

## Configuration

Any configuration is expected to be driven by environment variables when the service is run in production as per [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/config).

However when running locally in development mode or in test it makes use of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package. This is a shim that will load values stored in a `.env` file into the environment which the service will then pick up as though they were there all along.

Check out [.env.example](/.env.example) for details of the required things you'll need in your `.env` file.

Refer to the [config files](config) for details of all the configuration used.
