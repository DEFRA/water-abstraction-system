This API provides an interface for calculating charges, queuing transactions and generating transaction files used to produce invoices.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- [Node.js v20.\*](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL v14](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Running locally

This is one of a number of apps that make up the Water Resource Licencing service. Because of the service's complex infrastructure there is a separate project available that will build a fully working WRLS environment, using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). We recommend reaching out to the [Water Abstraction team](https://github.com/orgs/DEFRA/teams/water-abstraction) and requesting access to **wal-dev-environment** if you need to get this project up and running.

## Configuration

> This is automatically setup when running locally using **wal-dev-environment**

Any configuration is expected to be driven by environment variables when the service is run in production as per [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/config).

However when running locally in development mode or in test it makes use of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package. This is a shim that will load values stored in a `.env` file into the environment which the service will then pick up as though they were there all along.

Check out [.env.example](/.env.example) for details of the required things you'll need in your `.env` file.

Refer to the [config files](config) for details of all the configuration used.

## Contributing to this project

If you have an idea you'd like to contribute please log an issue.

All contributions should be submitted via a pull request.

The code style is dictated by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and we follow [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) code rules as implemented by [neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard). This is all managed through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) so should play nice with all IDE's.

## üõ† Scaffold Script for adding new Journeys

Quickly generates source files and matching test files based on templates.

---

### ‚úÖ Usage

```bash
./scaffold.sh <name> or <path/to/name>
```

---

### üìã Examples

```bash
./scaffold.sh my-module
# ‚Üí app/services/my-module.service.js
# ‚Üí test/services/my-module.service.test.js

./scaffold.sh notices/setup/fella/my-module
# ‚Üí app/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.js
# ‚Üí test/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.test.js
```

---

### üì¶ Scaffold Options

After running, you'll be prompted to choose:

1. Journey - Complete
2. Journey - View
3. Journey - Submit
4. Presenter only
5. Service only
6. Service with Fetch

‚û°Ô∏è Templates are selected and filled automatically depending on your choice.

---

### üõ† Key Features

- Always generates both source files and corresponding test files.
- Correct `require()` paths are dynamically calculated based on folder depth.
- Handles nested folder structures under `services/` cleanly.
- Correct relative pathing for `SessionModel` imports inside services.
- Skips file creation if the file already exists (safe by default).

---

### üß† Special Handling

- **`render_file()`**: Renders the actual source file (Service, Presenter, FetchService).
- **`render_test_file()`**: Renders the corresponding test file.
- **SessionModel imports** are dynamically resolved based on service file depth.

---

### üõ† Path Calculation Rules

- **`build_up_path()`**: Calculates how many `../` are needed in tests to require the correct source file.
- **`build_session_model_path()`**: Calculates how many `../` are needed to correctly import `models/session.model.js` inside a service.

**Example**:

```text
Service at: app/services/a/b/c/my-service.service.js
Will import: ../../../../models/session.model.js
```

### üìã Placeholders Replaced in Templates

These placeholders are automatically replaced inside templates:

| Placeholder              | Description                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `__MODULE_NAME__`        | PascalCase name of the module          |
| `__REQUIRE_PATH__`       | Path to the source file from test file |
| `__DESCRIBE_LABEL__`     | Test suite name for `describe()`       |
| `__PRESENTER_NAME__`     | PascalCase Presenter module name       |
| `__PRESENTER_PATH__`     | Path to Presenter file                 |
| `__FETCH_NAME__`         | PascalCase FetchService module name    |
| `__FETCH_PATH__`         | Path to FetchService file              |
| `__SESSION_MODEL_PATH__` | Path to `models/session.model.js`      |
| `__VALIDATOR_NAME__`     | PascalCase Validator module name       |
| `__VALIDATOR_PATH__`     | Path to Validator file                 |
