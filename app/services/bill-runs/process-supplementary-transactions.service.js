/**
 * Fetches matching debit transactions from previous bill runs, then compares them as credits to those just generated
 *
 * The `FetchPreviousTransactionsService` finds _all_ previous debit and credit transactions. It then compares the
 * debits to the credits. If they match, the debit transaction is dropped. This is because it must have been dealt with
 * by a previous supplementary bill run.
 *
 * Any debits that remain are then reversed as credits. These are then compared against the ones we've generated for the
 * bill run in progress.
 *
 * If any matches occur here, both transactions are dropped. There is no point in sending them to the Charging Module
 * API and including them in the bill, as the result will just be Â£0, and we've been asked to limit zero-value bills
 * where we can.
 *
 * Any generated transactions and reversed debits (now credits) that didn't match are returned as the transactions to be
 * sent to the Charging Module API, and included in the bill.
 *
 * @param {object[]} generatedTransactions - The generated transactions for the bill licence being processed
 * @param {string} billLicenceId - The UUID that will be used for the bill licence we are processing transactions for
 * @param {string} billingAccountId - The UUID for the billing account we are processing transactions for and for which
 * we need to fetch previous transactions
 * @param {string} licenceId - The UUID for the licence we are processing transactions for and  and for which we need to

 * @param {number} financialYearEnding - Which financial year to look for previous transactions in
