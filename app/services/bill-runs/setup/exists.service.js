/**
 * Determines if an existing bill run matches the one a user is trying to setup
 *
 * Once the user completes the bill run setup journey we first need to check if a matching bill run already exists.
 *
 * The criteria though can differ depending on the details selected. For example, you can only have 1 annual bill run
 * per region per year. Supplementary you can have as many as you like but never more than one in process. Two-part
 * tariff depending on the year you can have either 2 or 1.
 *
 * All this needs to be taken into account when determining if a 'matching' bill run exists. If it does we prepare
 * `pageData` and the controller will render the `create` page. If it doesn't it will kick off generating the bill run.
 *
 * @param {string} sessionId - The UUID for setup bill run session record
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} It always returns the session and the results of looking for matching bill runs plus a
 * `pageData:` property.
 *
 * If no matches are found `pageData` will be `null`.
 *
 * If the bill run to be setup is annual or two-part tariff and a match is found `pageData` will be the matching bill
 * run's data formatted for use in the '/exists' page.
 *
 * If the bill run is supplementary and 2 matches are found it returns the most recent match formatted for use in the
 * '/exists' page.
