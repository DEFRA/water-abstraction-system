/**
 * Returns the authorised and billable days for a given charge reference based on its abstraction periods
 *
 * In WRLS the charge element, linked to a charge version via the charge reference, holds the abstraction period
 * information. The abstraction period is the time when a licensee is permitted to abstract water. They are held as a
 * start and end day and month, for example 1 Apr to 31 Oct. They do not have years because the intent is they are the
 * same period no matter what year it is.
 *
 * **Authorised** days is how much of the billing period overlaps with the abstraction period. **Billable** days is how
 * much of the charge period overlaps with the abstraction period (see params for explanations of billable and charge
 * periods).
 *
 * Calculating these values is complicated by the fact a charge reference may have multiple abstraction periods. Added
 * to that abstraction periods do not intersect nicely with billing or charge periods. The abstraction period might
 * start or end outside of the billing period, and so apply twice! For example, 1 Jan to 30 Jun intersects twice with a
 * billing period of 2022-04-01 to 2023-03-31.
 *
 * - **1 Jan 2022 to 30 Jun 2022** intersects as 1 Apr 2022 to 30 Jun 2022
 * - **1 Jan 2023 to 30 Jun 2023** intersects as 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Mar 2023
 *
 * The number of days the abstraction period intersects either the billing or charge period is where we get our 'days'
 * from. The final complication is we cannot double count. If 2 charge elements have abstraction periods that overlap we
 * must only count one of them. For example
 *
 * - charge element 1 has **1 Jan to 30 Jun**
 * - charge element 2 has **1 May to 31 Oct**
 *
 * They overlap 1 May to 30 Jun. To get our days we summate the result for each abstraction period and have to ensure we
 * only count this once.
 *
 * So, a charge element's abstraction dates might result in 2 relevant abstraction periods. A charge reference might
 * have multiple charge elements. But we must return a single **Authorised** and **Billable** days calculation. This
 * problem is what this service tackles.
 *
 * @param {{startDate: Date, endDate: Date}} chargePeriod Charge period is determined as the overlap between a charge
 *  version's start and end dates, and the billing period's (financial year) start and end dates. So, when the charge
 *  version and billing period are compared the charge period's start date is the latest of the two, and the end date is
 *  the earliest of their end dates
 * @param {{startDate: Date, endDate: Date}} billingPeriod The period a bill run is being calculated for. Currently,
 *  this always equates to a financial year, for example, 2022-04-01 to 2023-03-31
 * @param {module:ChargeReferenceModel} chargeReference A charge version can have multiple charge references, though
 *  each will have a different reference, for example, 4.1.10. Each reference can have multiple charge elements and it's
 *  these that hold the abstraction period data
 *
 * @returns {Object} An object containing an `authorisedDays` and `billableDays` property

/**
 * Calculates the period that an abstraction period overlaps the reference period
 *
 * Before we can work out either the authorised or billable days, we first need to work out what part of the abstraction
 * period overlaps.
 *
 * The simplest way to look at this is that the overlapping period is the latest start date and the earliest end date.
 *
 * So, for example, the abstraction period has been calculated as 01-JAN-2022 to 30-JUN-2022 and our reference is the
 * billing period (ie. 31-MAR-2022 to 01-APR-2023). Then the overlap period is 01-APR-2022 to 30-JUN-2022.
 *
 * Other scenarios we have to handle are
 *
 * - 01-JUL-2022 to 31-DEC-2022 - overlap is also 01-JUL-2022 to 31-DEC-2022 because it falls inside the billing period
 * - 01-NOV-2022 to 31-MAY-2023 - overlap is 01-NOV-2022 to 31-MAR-2023
 *
 * @param {Object} referencePeriod either the billing period or charge period
 * @param {Object} abstractionPeriod an object containing `startDate` and `endDate` date representing the abstraction
 *  period relative to the reference
 *
 * @returns {Object} an object with a start and end date representing the part of the abstraction period that overlaps
 *  the reference period
