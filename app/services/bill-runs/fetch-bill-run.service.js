/**
 * Query the DB and generate a summary for each bill linked to the bill run
 *
 * On the page we need to show the following in a table for every bill linked to the bill run
 *
 * - billing account number
 * - billing contact
 * - a list of licences references included in the bill
 * - financial year (displayed in supplementary bill runs)
 * - total net amount for the bill
 *
 * We also need to work out if any of the licences linked to a bill are flagged as 'water undertaker'. Historically,
 * annual bill runs display the bills grouped by 'Water companies' and 'Other abstractors'. So, if a bill is linked to
 * a licence that is flagged as a water undertaker that bill needs to be shown under 'Water companies'.
 *
 * Because we have to dip into a different schema to get billing account information Objection.js not available to us.
 * So, immediately we are required to use Knex. But then we have 2 sub-queries to perform
 *
 * - **get a list of linked licences as a single result** - Because a bill can be linked to 1 or more licences we can
 *  not use a JOIN. So, instead we use a function built into PostgreSQL that allows you to aggregate multiple results
 *  into a single value. (We can easily split them out again using JavaScripts `split()` method)
 * - **flag the bill as a water company** - Again we have to avoid joining to the `licences` table via
 *  `bill_licences` as we'll get duplicate results. So, again we use a PostgreSQL function that will return
 *  true or false based on the query provided to it.
 *
 * We could have made things simpler by performing separate queries and then transforming all the results into what we
 * need this service to return. But we opted to go for performance this time, avoiding multiple requests to the DB and
 * getting the query to provide the data we need without having to transform the result.
