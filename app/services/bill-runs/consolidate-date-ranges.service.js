/**
 * Consolidate date ranges by merging all overlapping ranges and returning an array of the resulting ranges. Note that
 * the returned range will be sorted in order of start date, from earliest to latest.
 *
 * Say we have the following dates:
 *
 * [
 *   { startDate: 2023-01-01, endDate: 2023-03-01 }, // Range 1
 *   { startDate: 2023-02-01, endDate: 2023-04-01 }, // Range 2
 *   { startDate: 2023-06-01, endDate: 2023-07-01 }  // Range 3
 * ]
 *
 * The first two date ranges overlap (as the second one starts before the first one ends) so we merge them into one date
 * range. The third date range does not overlap anything, so we leave it alone. Our resulting consolidated date ranges
 * therefore looks like this:
 *
 * [
 *   { startDate: 2023-01-01, endDate: 2023-04-01 }, // Ranges 1 & 2 merged
 *   { startDate: 2023-06-01, endDate: 2023-07-01 }  // Range 3 unchanged
 * ]
 *
 * Note that if a range starts on the same day the previous range ends, that is classed as one continuous range. But a
 * range that starts the day _after_ the previous range ends is classed as a separate range to that previous one. eg:
 *
 * [
 *   { startDate: 2023-01-01, endDate: 2023-04-01 }, // Range 1, ending on 1st April
 *   { startDate: 2023-04-01, endDate: 2023-07-01 }, // Range 2, starting on 1st April
 *   { startDate: 2023-10-01, endDate: 2023-10-31 }, // Range 3, ending on 31st October
 *   { startDate: 2023-11-01, endDate: 2023-12-01 }  // Range 4, starting on 1st November
 * ]
 *
 * Consolidates to:
 *
 * [
 *   { startDate: 2023-01-01, endDate: 2023-07-01 }, // Ranges 1 & 2 merged
 *   { startDate: 2023-10-01, endDate: 2023-10-31 }, // Range 3 unchanged
 *   { startDate: 2023-11-01, endDate: 2023-12-01 }  // Range 4 unchanged
 * ]
 *
 * @param {Object[]} dateRanges - The series of date ranges to be consolidated.
 * @param {Date} dateRanges[].startDate - The start date for the range
 * @param {Date} dateRanges[].endDate - The end date of the range
 *
 * @returns {Object[]} An array of the consolidated date ranges
