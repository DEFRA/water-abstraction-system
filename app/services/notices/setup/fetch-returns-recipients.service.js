/**
 * Fetches the returns recipients data for the `/notices/setup/check` page
 *
 * > IMPORTANT! The source for notification contacts is `crm.document_headers` (view `licence_document_headers`), not
 * > the tables in `crm_v2`.
 *
 * Our overall goal is that a 'recipient' receives only one notification, irrespective of how many licences they are
 * linked to, or what roles they have.
 *
 * We have two mechanisms for returning a recipient. One is for an individual licence, based on the 'licenceRef. And
 * the other is for any journey that needs multiple recipients based on the selected returns period.
 *
 * For the individual licence we determine the recipients from the returns logs based on the provided 'licenceRef'.
 *
 * We start by determining which licence we need to send notifications for, by
 * looking for return logs with a matching 'licenceRef' the user has entered.
 *
 * For the multiple recipients journey we start by determining which licences we need to send notifications for, by
 * looking for 'due' return logs with a matching 'due date' and cycle (summer or winter and all year).
 *
 * For each licence linked to one of these return logs, we extract the contact information. This is complicated by a
 * number of factors.
 *
 * - if a licence is _registered_ (more details below), we only care about the email addresses registered against it
 * - all licences should have a 'licence holder' contact, but they may also have a 'returns' contact
 * - there is a one-to-one relationship between `licences` and `licence_document_headers`, but the same contact (licence
 * holder or returns) can appear in different licences, and we are expected to group them into a 'single' contact
 *
 * WRLS has the concept of a registered and unregistered licences:
 *
 * - **Unregistered licences** have not been linked to an external email, so do not have a 'primary user'. All licences
 * have a contact with the role 'Licence holder', so this will be extracted as a 'contact'. They may also have a
 * contact with the role 'Returns to' (but only one), which is extracted as well.
 * - **Registered licences** have been linked to an external email. That initial email will be linked as the 'primary
 * user'. These licences may also have designated other accounts as 'returns agents', which will be extracted as well.
 *
 * If a licence is registered, we only extract the email contacts. Unregistered licences its the 'Licence holder' and
 * 'Returns to' contacts from `licence_document_headers.metadata->contacts`.
 *
 * Because we are working with `licence_document_header` we get one row per licence. So, the next step is to group the
 * contacts by their contact information.
 *
 * We do this by generating a hash ID using PostgreSQL's
 * {@link https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-binarystring.html | md5() function}. For email contacts, we
 * simply hash the email address. For letter contacts, we extract key fields out of the JSON in `metadata`, convert them
 * to lowercase, concatenate them, and then generate an `md5()` result from it.
 *
 * This means we can identify 'duplicate' contacts. For example, we can determine these contact records will result in
 * the same 'recipient'.

 * ```json
 * {
 *  "name": "Acme Ltd",
 *  "role": "Licence holder",
 *  "town": "Shifnal",
 *  "type": "Organisation",
 *  "county": "Shropshire",
 *  "country": null,
 *  "forename": null,
 *  "initials": null,
 *  "postcode": "TF11 8UP",
 *  "salutation": null,
 *  "addressLine1": "Cosford Court",
 *  "addressLine2": null,
 *  "addressLine3": null,
 *  "addressLine4": null
 * },
 * {
 *  "name": "ACME Ltd",
 *  "role": "Licence holder",
 *  "town": "Shifnal",
 *  "type": "Organisation",
 *  "county": "SHROPSHIRE",
 *  "country": null,
 *  "forename": null,
 *  "initials": null,
 *  "postcode": "TF11 8UP",
 *  "salutation": null,
 *  "addressLine1": "Cosford Court",
 *  "addressLine2": null,
 *  "addressLine3": null,
 *  "addressLine4": null
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > The deduping is very basic. We don't account for Ltd vs Limited, FAO Jon vs Jon, etc. But just doing this reduces
 * > the number of recipients receiving duplicate notifications considerably compared to the legacy notification engine.
 *
 * The subquery determines which contacts to return and their hash ID. The top level part of the query then groups these
 * results to remove the first tranche of duplicates. These are where, for example, 10 licences are all linked to the
 * same primary user. Apart from the licence ref, all other fields will be the same. So, PostgreSQL can aggregate the
 * licence refs into a single value, and group the rest into a single row.
 *
 * Those contacts with the same hash ID that cannot be grouped, for example, because one has the `contact_type='Licence
 * holder'` and the other `contact_type='Returns to'` will be handled by `DetermineRecipientsService`.
 *
 * For the individual licence the end result is all the email, or letter contacts for that  licence with a 'due'
 * return for any period.
 *
 * For the multiple recipient journeys the end result is all the email, or letter contacts for each licence with a 'due'
 * return for the period selected.
