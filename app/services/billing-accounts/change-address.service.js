/**
 * Manages the changing of an address for a billing (invoice) account
 *
 * Within the service an internal user can 'Change the address' of a billing account. That is what the button says but
 * they can also change or set the agent company and the contact along with the address.
 *
 * Behind the scenes a new `crm_v2.invoice_account_address` record is created that links to the `crm_v2.address`,
 * `crm_v2.company` and `crm_v2.contact` records. It will also be linked to the `crm_v2.invoice_account` which
 * represents the billing account being amended.
 *
 * It won't have an end date, which marks it as the 'current' address. The previous `invoice_account_address` will get
 * its `end_date` updated. The legacy service then knows that address is no longer current.
 *
 * When a change like this is made SOP, the system that sends invoices to customers, needs to know about it. That
 * process is handled by the {@link https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-charging-module-api | Charging Module API}. So, as
 * well as updating our records we need to send a request to the CHA.
 *
 * The complexity comes from the legacy database and how it has been designed
 *
 * - the source for addresses, companies and contacts is NALD and WRLS. But rather than transform them at ingress to a
 *   single format the tables manage both. For example, NALD contacts use `initials` whereas WRLS contacts use
 *   `middle_initials`. A contact can also be a 'department' under WRLS, which means the format changes again
 * - where possible duplication of records has tried to be avoided. For example, you cannot have 2 addresses with the
 *   same UPRN, or 2 companies with the same company number. The problem is the source data _does_ change. We have seen
 *   the OS Places result for Horizon House change from Environment Agency, to Natural England, Defra and back to the
 *   Environment Agency over the years. This means when a user changes the address, for example, they may actually be
 *   selecting one that already exists based on UPRN, in which case we are not inserting a new record but using an
 *   existing one
 *
 * Add to that all SOP wants is a name and address which means we have to do a lot of work to format the data we receive
 * into something the CHA will accept.
 *
 * @param {String} invoiceAccountId The UUID for the billing (invoice) account being updated
 * @param {Object} address The validated address details
 * @param {Object} [agentCompany] The validated agent company details
 * @param {Object} [contact] The validated contact details
 *
 * @returns {Object} contains a copy of the persisted address, agent company and contact if they were also changed

  // In the legacy code we updated our DB first then let the Charging Module know. But if the CHA request failed it
  // would appear to the user all was well; the address is updated in our service.
  //
  // Now we attempt to update the CHA first. We only attempt to update our DB if it succeeded (it will throw an error if
  // it doesn't). If the CHA fails the user will know. If the CHA succeeds but our update fails the user will still see
  // an error and try again. It matters not that we send the same information to the CHA; either way it will overwrite
  // what is either in it or SOP. But this way the user is never left believing all is well when something has failed.

 * get applied, or none do (no partial updates here!)
 *
 * When a user changes a billing account address we expect as a minimum that an 'address' will be passed to this
 * service. Agent company and contact can be null though. But before the service calls this method it will transform all
 * 3 into their respective model instances. So, address will always be populated, but company and contact might be empty
 * instances.
 *
 * We attempt to persist the address, company and contact model instances first because we need their IDs in order to
 * create the new `crm_v2.invoice_account_address` record. When we create that record we also need to apply an end date
 * to any existing invoice account addresses with a null end date. This is how the service determines which address
 * details are current (end date is null).
 *
 * The object we return has all 3 entities whether they were persisted or not. This gets passed back to the UI via the
 * controller and is what it needs to then be able to redirect the user to the correct page.
 *
 * @param {Date} timestamp the timestamp to be used for any date created or updated values when persisting
 * @param {module:InvoiceAccountModel} invoiceAccount the invoice (billing) account having its address changed
