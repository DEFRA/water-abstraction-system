/**
 * Fetches licences that have a related charge element that is due to expire in less than 50 days
 *
 * To be selected the licence must
 *
 * - not have expired
 * - not be revoked
 * - not have lapsed
 * - have an 'sroc' charge version with the status of `current` that does not have an `endDate`. The lack of an endDate
 * indicates that the charge version is the latest and has not been replaced/superseded etc
 * - not be linked to a licence in the workflow
 * - have a related `purpose` that is due to expire in less than 50 days
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object[]>} The licence IDs with time-limited elements and their current licence version ID (needed
 * else we break the workflow). Also the ID of the charge version that has the time limited charge element
