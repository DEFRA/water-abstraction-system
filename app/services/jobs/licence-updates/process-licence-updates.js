/**
 * Puts licences into workflow that have a licence version created in last 2 months and no existing workflow record
 *
 * This replaces a legacy job in the
 * {@link https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-service | water-abstraction-service}. The intent is to flag any new
 * licence or licence with a new licence version. New licences will need their charge versions created. Existing ones
 * will need their charge versions double-checked.
 *
 * Ideally, this would be done at the same time the licence version is created by
 * {@link https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-import | water-abstraction-import}. But that wasn't done plus there
 * is a complication for the old PRESROC billing engine. WATER-3528 was found when licences linked to in-progress bill
 * runs were added to workflow (this is not an issue for our SROC billing engines).
 *
 * Instead, a job is run that looks for licence versions created in the last 2 months (we think the 2 month window was
 * to allow those licences linked to bill runs to still get flagged once the bill run is completed). If there is no
 * workflow record with a status of `to_setup` the licence is deemed to have been updated.
 *
 * This means a workflow record for the licence version needs to be created. This stops the licence from being included
 * in future bill runs until Billing & Data have had a chance to review the existing charge versions. This is because
 * the change to the licence might require changes to the charge versions.
