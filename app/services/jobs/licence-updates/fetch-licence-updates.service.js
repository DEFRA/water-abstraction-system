 * Fetches licence versions that were created in last two months that have no matching workflow record
 *
 * If a licence was created in the last two moths and doesn't have a `to_setup` record in workflow it is deemed to have
 * been 'updated.
 *
 * Note, if the licence version is linked to a licence that is part of an in-progress PRESROC bill run it will be
 * excluded from the results (see {@link https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WATER-3528 | WATER-3528}).
 *
 * Also, if a workflow record already exists for the licence version, for example, it is already under review, it will
 * also be excluded from the results.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object[]>} The ID for each licence version created in the last 2 months without a workflow record,
 * plus associated licence ID and whether a charge version exists for the licence
