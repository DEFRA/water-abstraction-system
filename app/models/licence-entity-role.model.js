 * Represents an instance of a licence entity role record

 * For reference, the licence entity role record is related to functionality that was added when the service was first built.
 * It sits in the old `crm` schema and was not migrated to `crm_v2` as part of the previous team's efforts to replace
 * the old legacy CRM setup.
 *
 * Currently, the only reason we need it is to identify if a licence has a 'registered user'. You'll see this
 * highlighted when you view a licence.
 *
 * From it we can identify the 'entity' which has the role of primary user.
