/**
 * Objection model that represents a `company` in the `crm_v2.companies` table
 *
 * ### Notes
 *
 * There is no `dataSource` field in the table. But anything that has `externalId` populated can be assumed to have been
 * imported from NALD and everything else directly entered into WRLS.
 *
 * For all records `name` and `type` are set
 *
 * When the source is 'nald'
 *
 * - `companyNumber` is always null
 * - `organisationType` is always null
 * - `lastHash` is always set
 * - `currentHash` is always set
 * - `externalId` is always set
 *
 * When the source is 'wrls'
 *
 * - `lastHash` is always null
 * - `currentHash` is always null
 * - `externalId` is always null
 * - if `type` is 'organisation' then `companyNumber` is always set
 * - if `type` is 'organisation' then `organisationType` can be null or set
 * - if `type` is 'person' then `companyNumber` is always null
 * - if `type` is 'person' then `organisationType` is always null
 * - as of 2023-08-01 there were 28 companies with `type` set to 'organisation'
 *
 * We currently do not know how `organisationType` gets populated!
