 *
 * - `contactType` is always null
 * - `department` is always null
 * - `middleInitials` is always null

 * - `externalId` is always set
 *
 * When the `dataSource` is 'wrls'
 *
 * - `contactType` is always set
 * - `initials` is always null
 * - `externalId` is always null
 * - if `middleInitials` is set then `firstName` is always set
 * - a 'person' always has `firstName` and `lastName` set
 * - a 'person' can have `department` populated
 * - a 'department' will only have `department` populated
 * - as of 2023-08-01 there were 6 contacts with `suffix` populated out of 42,827 (1,621 WRLS)
