   * The session table, excluding `id` and the timestamps, only contains one field; `data`. It is a JSONB field so
   * it is flexible enough to hold whatever data an individual needs.
   *
   * To improve working with the session and avoid callers having to do _everything_ via `session.data` we use this
   * `$afterFind()` hook to elevate the properties of `.data` to the top level of the instance.
   *
   * So, if `session.data` contained `{ reason: 'major-change' }` after a caller fetched the session instance they would
   * be able to call and update `session.reason` instead.
   *
   * We think this makes working with the `SessionModel` the same as working with the normal, structured model
   * instances.

   * currentData.reason = payload.reason

   *
   * ```javascript
   * session.reason = payload.reason
   * session.$update()

   * Ignoring `id` and the timestamps, this method extracts all the other properties on the instance into an object
   * then calls `patch({ data: currentData })`, saving calling modules the trouble!
   *
   * @returns {Promise<Number>} - the number of affected rows. In our case this will always be 1!
