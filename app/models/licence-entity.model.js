/**
 * Represents an instance of a licence entity record
 *
 * For reference, the licence entity record is related to functionality that was added when the service was first built.
 * It sits in the old `crm` schema and was not migrated to `crm_v2` as part of the previous team's efforts to replace
 * the old legacy CRM setup.
 *
 * Currently, the only reason we need it is to identify if a licence has a 'registered user'. You'll see this
 * highlighted when you view a licence.
 *
 * But the reason it is called `entity` in the `crm` schema is because it was intended to be a generic bucket of
 * 'things'. So, you'll find 4 types if you look at the raw data.
 *
 * - regime (only one record has this type and comes from the original team being pressured to create a tactical CRM for
 *   all regimes, not just water abstraction)
 * - company (this has been replaced by `crm_v2.companies`)
 * - individual (this has been replaced by `crm_v2.companies`, except for registered users which is the only reason we
 *   need to add this model)
 * - delete_me (no idea! But only one record has this type so it can be ignored)
