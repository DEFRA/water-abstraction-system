 * Represents an instance of a bill run charge version year record
 *
 * For reference, the bill run charge version year record is a 'nothing' record! Certainly as far as we are concerned.
 *
 * They use this table when generating pre-sroc bill runs. We think it was mainly to support supplementary bill runs
 * and the fact they cover a range of years rather than a single period.
 *
 * We haven't needed to do anything like this in our engine and nothing else appears to use this table. The only reason
 * we reference it is to delete stuff when a bill run gets cancelled.
 *
 * Welcome to dealing with the legacy database schema! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
