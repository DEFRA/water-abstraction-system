/**
 * Generates the request data needed for the Charging ModuleAPI  `/customer-changes` endpoint from the instances
 *
 * > NOTE: Because the presenter relies on call the `ContactModel`s `$name()` instance method we chose to build the
 * > presenter on the basis that all the object's passed in would be Objection JS model instances. However, where
 * > an instance has not been set, for example, the user didn't add an FAO to the new address the instance will
 * > be empty.
 *
 * The previous team opted to record 4 lines of address information, plus town, county, country and postcode. Added to
 * that they wished to give users the option to add an FAO. This means we have 9 lines of address information we have
 * to squeeze into 7.
 *
 * At time of implementation we are tasked with replicating the existing functionality and working with the existing
 * change address journey in the UI and the data it forwards to us. So, we have to replicate what the legacy code was
 * doing.
 *
 * In essence, if it can the presenter will just place the WRLS data as address lines 1 to 6. If it has too much data it
 * then makes decisions about concatenating the FAO and the first populated address line and whether to concatenate
 * county and country.
 *
 * The final twist is in WRLS only one of the 4 address lines need to be populated, it doesn't matter which. The CHA
 * requires `addressLine1` to be populated. So, the presenter has to 'squash' the 4 WRLS address lines to remove gaps
 * and ensure it has something to put in `addressLine1`.
 *
 * For reference the schema for the Charging Module request body is
 *
 * - region: 'B' (required)
 * - customerReference: 'B19120000A' max(12) (required)
 * - customerName: 'Mr W Aston' max(360) (required)
 * - addressLine1: 'Park Farm' max(240) (required)
 * - addressLine2: 'Sugar Lane' max(240)
 * - addressLine3: 'West Waterford' max(240)
 * - addressLine4: 'Angleton' max(240)
 * - addressLine5: 'Southampton' max(60)
 * - addressLine6: 'Hampshire' max(60)
 * - postcode: 'SO74 3KD' max(60)
 *
 * Anything set to null the Charging Module API will set to `null` in the record it sends to SSCL.
 *
 * @param {module:BillingAccountModel} billingAccount the billing account having its address changed
 * (required)
 * @param {module:AddressModel} address the address it is being changed to (required)
 * @param {module:CompanyModel} company the agent company selected or created during the process (if the user made no
 * change to the agent company this should be an unset instance)
 * @param {module:ContactModel} contact the contact created during the process (if the user did not create an FAO this
 * should be an unset instance)
 *
 * @returns {Object} the request data needed in the format required by the Charging Module
