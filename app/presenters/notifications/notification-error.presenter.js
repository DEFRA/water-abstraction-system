/**
 * Formats error details from a notification ready for presenting in the view notification page
 *
 * If the notification does not have a status of `error` it returns `null`.
 *
 * Else it determines a status and description to display on the view notification page based on the `notifyStatus`
 * and the `notifyError`.
 *
 * Generally the `notifyError` will get populated when a notification fails to send to Notify, for whatever reason
 * (issue on our side or Notify rejects it).
 *
 * This means `notifyStatus` will not get populated. If we have managed to send it, then we are interested in what
 * `notifyStatus` says, because we've marked the notification as errored because of it.
 *
 * We relay the description Notify provides in its docs when this is the case. We default to a generic message for
 * system errors because we're dealing with old records that might have all sorts in those error messages!
 *
 * > When compiling this presenter we did confirm there are no notifications with a `notifyStatus` of 'delivered' or
 * > 'received' (which means it was successful) but a status of 'error'. Hence, that is not a scenario we cover.
 *
 * @param {object} notification - The notification object to format error details for
 *
 * @returns {object|null} If the notification is not errored returns null, else an applicable 'status' and 'description'
