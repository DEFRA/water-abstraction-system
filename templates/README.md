# üõ† Scaffolding for Adding New Journeys

Quickly generates source files and matching test files based on predefined templates. Helps you scaffold views, services, validators, presenters, and matching test files with correct relative imports and paths.

## ‚úÖ Usage

```bash
./scaffold.sh <name> or <path/to/name>
```

## üìã Examples

```bash
./scaffold.sh my-module
# ‚Üí app/services/my-module.service.js
# ‚Üí test/services/my-module.service.test.js

./scaffold.sh notices/setup/fella/my-module
# ‚Üí app/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.js
# ‚Üí test/services/notices/setup/fella/my-module.service.test.js
```

## üì¶ Scaffold Options

After running, you'll be prompted to choose:

1. Journey - Complete - _Generates:_ Presenter, View, Service, SubmitService, Validator
2. Journey - View - _Generates:_ Presenter, View, Service
3. Journey - Submit - _Generates:_ SubmitService, Validator

‚û°Ô∏è Templates are selected and filled automatically depending on your choice.

## üîß Output Files

- **Source files** go into `app/{services|presenters|validators|views}/`
- **Test files** go into `test/{services|presenters|validators}/`
- **View files** go into `app/views/` but don‚Äôt have test counterparts
- **Helper snippet** with controller and router boilerplate is printed on completion

## üõ† Key Features

- Always generates both source and test files
- Skips file creation if file already exists (safe by default)
- Handles nested folders cleanly
- Correct `require()` paths are calculated dynamically
- View templates and controller helpers are scaffolded for you

## üß† Special Handling

- **`render_file()`**: Renders source files (Presenter, Service, SubmitService, etc.)
- **`render_test_file()`**: Renders corresponding test files
- **SessionModel imports** are dynamically resolved based on file depth

## üóÇ Path Calculation Rules

- **`build_up_path()`**: Figures out how many `../` are needed to reach base from nested folders
- Paths like `models/session.model.js`, presenter, and validator are injected based on folder depth

**Example**:

```text
Service at: app/services/a/b/c/my-service.service.js
Will import: ../../../../models/session.model.js
```
